## 2. Components

### 2.1. `samsungac`

This climate component allows you to control Samsung AC units by sending an infrared (IR) control signal, just as the unitâ€™s handheld remote controller would.
You need to set receiver idle time to above 18ms.

#### 2.1.1. Example

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://adwiraguna/esphome-components@main
    components: [ samsungac ]

remote_receiver:
  id: ir_receiver
  pin:
    number: GPIO5
    inverted: true
  tolerance: 55%
  idle: 20ms

climate:
  - platform: samsungac
    name: "Living Room AC"
    receiver_id: ir_receiver
```
